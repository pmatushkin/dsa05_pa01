# Data Structures and Algorithms
## Advanced Algorithms And Complexity Programming Assignment 01: Flows in Networks
### Problems
Practice implementing and applying algorithms for finding maximum flows in networks:
* [`/src/evacuation/Evacuation.java`](src/evacuation/Evacuation.java): Problem 1, Evacuating People, determines how fast people can be evacuated from the given city (PASSED);
* [`/src/airline_crews/AirlineCrews.java`](src/airline_crews/AirlineCrews.java): Problem 2, Assigning Airline Crews to Flights, assigns airline crews to flights in the most efficient way;
* [`/src/stock_charts/StockCharts.java`](src/stock_charts/StockCharts.java): Advanced Problem 3, Stock Charts, finds the most compact way of visualizing stock price data using charts.
